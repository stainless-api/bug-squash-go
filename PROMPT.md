This is an exercise in improving an API client library, just as you might
do at Stainless.

A contributor has been trying to add support for idempotency to the Stainless
Go client library for Increase. They've got some WIP code as shown in this
repo.

But some tests are failing now, and they're not sure why, or what to do next.
They've asked for your help.

Your task is to figure out what's wrong and to improve idempotency support in
this library.

You may use outside resources like Google and may also ask questions of
your interviewer. Please don't look in the production increase-go code though,
that might give away the answer too quickly!
